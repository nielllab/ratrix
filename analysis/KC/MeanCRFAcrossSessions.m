% how to get average CRF for one mouse over multiple sessions/days? w/error bars

% would I: 
% A) combine the matricies for each sessions's CRF into a huge matrix and
% take the mean at each contrast % stdev across the sessions dimension?
    % In other words, calculate the CRF for every session all at once
% B) calculate the CRF as I already amindividually, but saving out those
% last vectors w/7 crf values & 7 stdev, somehow combining the later? Even
% just overlayed on one graph would be cool
