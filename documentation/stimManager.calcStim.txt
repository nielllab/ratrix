% stimManager.calcStim()
% override this method to specify the visual stimulus and correct/incorrect reponses for a trial
% define your stimManager subclass to contain any necessary state
% calcStim output is interpreted by a trialManager, this document describes the interpretation by nAFC, freeDrinks, and their subclasses.
%
% calcStim can return either phased or non-phased outputs, depending on the return value of 'type'
% see below for more detailed description of each return value in both cases
% 
%
%

%                           the last element of trialRecords will the trialRecord for THIS trial (for access to the trainingStepNum, etc)
% OUTPUTS
%   stimulus                this images stimManager object
%   updateSM                boolean flag indicating whether you've changed state (field values) in this object that you'd like to persist for future reference

%                               the analog output hz you want to use for this trial (ignored if type is 'phased' - each stimSpec has its own hz)
%   out                     if type is 'expert':
%                               a struct with fields that are required, have no direct effect, but affect what is passed to your drawExpertFrame method:
%                                   floatprecision (as defined for screen('MakeTexture') -- will be passed to your drawExpertFrame method)
%                                   height (in pixels, will scale stim to this size to compute the destRect passed to your drawExpertFrame method)
%                                   width (as above)
%                           if type is 'phased':
%                               a cell vector of stimSpecs (see below + the stimSpec constructor help)
%                           otherwise:
%                               monochrome stimulus frames.  logical, real (0<=x<=1) [double single], or [uint8 uint16].  2 or 3 dimensional array (y,x,frame)
%                               uint8 values will be mapped to 8-bit clut indices
%                               uint16 are converted to singles and treated as float
%                               float (double, single) values will be processed at 16 bits until finally rendered through a potentially higher dynamic range clut           
%   LUT                     the color look up (gamma/linearization) table to pass to the gfx card
%                           must be 256 X 3 array, 0<=x<=1 (reallutsize from screen('ReadNormalizedGammaTable') is inaccurate -- can be 1024 on osx, but 'LoadNormalizedGammaTable' silently fails when table is longer than 256)
%                           on windows, table subject to unpublished constraints vaguely resembling monotonic increasing
%   scaleFactor             ignored if type is 'phased' (each stimSpec has its own scaleFactor)    
%                           (potentially non-integer) factors by which to scale stim when mapping onto pixels
%                               [height width]>0, special case scalar zero means scale to full screen
%                               scaleFactor.*[y x] (dimensions of out array) must not exceed the resolution you specify
%   type                    see below

%                           vector subset of responsePorts (disjoint with targetPorts) that will count as incorrect responses (remainder will be dead ports)
%                           if union(targetPorts distractorPorts) is empty, the trial ends when the stimulus ends, rather than waiting for a response
%                           for stimuli with no "end," union must not be empty, or there would be no way for the trial to end
%   details                 a structure of your design including parameters you choose in this method that will be saved with the trialRecord 
%   interTrialLuminance     ignored if type is 'phased' (make a "final" stimSpec that holds this value as you need)
%                           a scalar value.  class determins interpreation as for out.
%                           full field luminance at this value will be shown until the first request
%                           also held after this trial ends until the beginning of the next trial
%                           if requestPorts (determined by the trialManager) is empty, the stimulus you provide (out) starts immediately
%   text                    message to add to text label on each frame (can be single string or cell vector of length numFrames)
%   indexPulses             boolean vector same length as out indicating what to output on the station's indexPin during each frame (set to [] for all false)

% values for 'type,' their semantics, and restrictions 
% note that these options grew organically as they were needed scientifically
% they are not intended to be an elegant covering of the space of possibilities
% if creative use of these does not meet your needs, implement a new type!
% 
% type='phased'             'out' is a cell vector of stimSpecs (see stimSpec constructor help) (will not call the phaseify method)
%
% %%% For all other types listed below, phaseify will be called to convert the non-phased calcStim output to a phased version,
%       according to trialManagerClass. phaseify() will automatically convert the non-phased output to a stimSpec, with the appropriate behavior for
%       nAFC and freeDrinks. for future stimulus managers, however, calcStim should return phased outputs instead of relying on this method. 
%
% type='static'             show one single frame
% 
% type={'trigger' toggleStim}            show frame 1, except during requests, show frame 2
%	toggleStim=false:   requests are coextensive with beambreaks (eg for nose pokes)
%	toggleStim=true:    request state toggles with each beambreak (eg for lickometers)
%	union(targetPorts distractorPorts) must not be empty
% 
% type='cache'              play through the frames in order, once
% 
% type='loop'               play through the frames in order, looping.
% 	union(targetPorts distractorPorts) must not be empty
% 
% type={'timedFrames' [frameTimes]}        show frames in order, each for the specified number of screen refreshes
%	frameTimes is: 
%       a vector of length equal to number of frames (size(stim,3)))
%       all integers > 0 representing the number or refreshes to display each frame
%       a zero in the final entry means hold display of last frame (in which case union(targetPorts distractorPorts) must not be empty)
% 
% type={'indexedFrames' [frameIndices]}     show frames in some order, useful if frames would otherwise be redundant
% 	loops over frameIndices vector until response (union(targetPorts distractorPorts) must not be empty)
%	frameIndices is:
%       a vector of frame indices
%       all integers btw 1 and the number of frames (size(stim,3)))
% 
% type='dynamic'            will call frames=stimManager.moreStim(usefulState) to request additional frames whenever it runs out
%   not yet implemented 
%
% type='expert'            will call stimManager.drawExpertFrame before each frame
%   your stimManager should override this method and call ptb drawing functions directly
%   leave frame text stamps, frameDropCorner, screen('drawingfinished'), and screen('flip') to stimOGL
%   this is an opportunity to use the imaging pipeline and shader programs for fast GPU-based stim computation, see ptb examples:
%       PsychDemos\ProceduralGaborDemo.m
%       PsychDemos\ProceduralGarboriumDemo.m
%       PsychDemos\ContrastModulatedNoiseTheElegantStyleDemo.m

%       PsychAlpha\ImageUndistortionDemo.m
%       PsychAlpha\ImageWarpingDemo.m
%   other uses: fast GPU-based rotation available in screen('drawtexture'), stimulus is too large to precache but fast enough to dynamically compute, alphablending, etc.
%   don't forget to call screen('close',[textureIDs]) on textures you create after no longer using them so you don't run out of VRAM (they will be automatically destroyed at the end of the trial)
